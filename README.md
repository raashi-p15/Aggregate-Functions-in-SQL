<h1>Aggregate Functions and Grouping</h1>

<h2>📌Objective</h2>
<mark>Use aggregate functions and grouping to summarize data</mark><br>
In this task, I've used an employee database with various different tables to dive deep into and gain practical knowledge related to SQL Data Manipulation Language containing a number of diverse statements.


<h2> 📁 What's in this Repository? </h2>
1. <mark>README.md</mark> --> Project Description <br>
2. <mark>task_4_database.sql</mark> --> SQL script with employee database, containing tables EMP & DEPT with Employee and department information respectively<br>
3. <mark>aggregate_functions_grouping.sql</mark> --> SQL script with aggregate clauses COUNT, SUM, AVG and grouping with GROUP BY, along with a conditional HAVING clause.

<h2>🛠️ Tools and SQL Techniques Used</h2>
1. MySQL Workbench <br>
2. Basic SQL statement : <br>
      <mark>COUNT</mark> (count the total number of occurences)<br>
      <mark>SUM</mark> (calculating the sum of numeric datatype columns) <br>
     <mark>GROUP BY</mark> (grouping to summarize data) <br>
      <mark>HAVING</mark> (filtering groups using Having) <br>
      <mark>AVG</mark> (calculating average of the numeric datatype columns)<br>
      
<h2> 📈 Insights Derived </h2>
- Applying aggregate functions on numeric columns - SUM, AVG <br>
- Applying aggregate function COUNT on the whole table and columns (to exclude NULL)<br>
- Grouping through GROUP BY statement and summarizing data<br>
- Adding filters with HAVING clause <br>
- analysis of the database through various markers and conditions<br>
- applying aggregate functions to filter out columns and rows based on conditions 


<h2>📋Developer's Note</h2>
This task is meant to familarize you with aggregate SQL statements and grouping clauses as a part of DML.
